<h2>spiralcraft.lang package<br>
</h2>
The spiralcraft.lang package provides a high performance expression
language facility to help
developers perform tasks such as integrating application components,
binding user interfaces to data sources, and performing computations
across large amounts of data. <br>
<br>
Expressions composed in a syntax based on the Java language are
compiled into a set of "data pipes" called a Channel which combine
multiple data sources into a single computed result. Expressions are
evaluated against a Focus, which exposes a namespace of data sources
called a Context, as well as a 'default' data source called a Subject. <br>
<br>
Developers can implement custom namespaces and operations to expose
arbitrary object models to the expression evaluation mechanism. A Java
beans implementation is built into the the language facility, exposing
all Java object graphs for evaluation.<br>
<h3>Architecture<br>
</h3>
<h4>Expression</h4>
A sequence of names, literal values and operators which resolve to a
target
object (an application component or data value) when evaluated within
the
context of a Focus. Users and integrators of applications which expose
the
spiralcraft.lang syntax can use the language alone to customize a wide
variety
of behavioral and presentation elements.<br>
<br>
Programmatically, an Expression object is the compiled form of the
language syntax.<br>
<h4>Channel</h4>
A Channel provides bidirectional access to a target object reachable
from
a Focus, in a manner specified by an Expression. Application components
can
use channels to reference their interaction peers or to read and modify
data
points. Channels provide support for property change notifications, and
can be used as a basis for data propogation in a system.<br>
<br>
Channels are composed of Optics, which are chained together into a tree
which
composes a path from one or more aspects of the Focus the target of the
channel.
<h4>Optic</h4>
An Optic is a "data pipe" which provides a view of an application
object or data value. Many Optics are bidirectional, for example, a
bean property Optic can both get and set a bean property value. Optics
are implemented by the spiralcraft.lang
package and by applications which implement the spiralcraft.lang SPI,
providing
a broad array of functionality for navigating application object models
and
transforming data.
<h4>Focus</h4>
A Focus represents the Subject and Context of expression evaluation.<br>
<br>
A Focus is associated with an Context, which gives Channels access to
application or service provider specific namespaces. The Context
provides a set of names that can be defined by within an application
and referenced by an expression. For example, the expression "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">customer.id</span>" will use the
Context to look up the name "<span style="font-family: monospace;">customer</span>".
<br>
<br>
A Focus is optionally associated with a Subject which represents the
default target of expression evaluation. A Subject is normally used
when computations are performed against a set of data items. For
example, when the Subject is, say, a sales order, the expression "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">.amount*exchangeRate</span>" will
evaluate the "<span style="font-family: monospace;">amount</span>" name
against the implicit sales order object, and will dervice the value
of&nbsp; "<span style="font-family: monospace;">exchangeRate</span>"
from the context.<br>
<br>
A Focus can be incorporated into a hierarchy associated with various
layers of an application. A Focus resolution mechanism in the language
syntax exposes this hierarchy to the expression writer. For example,
the expression "<span style="font-family: monospace;">[Application]
status.displayName</span>" will resolve a Focus named "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Application</span>" by searching up
the Focus hierarchy, will resolve the name "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">status</span>" within the Context of
that Focus, and will resolve "<span style="font-family: monospace;">displayName</span>"
against the status object.<br>
