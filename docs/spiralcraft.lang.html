<h2>spiralcraft.lang package<br>
</h2>
The spiralcraft.lang package provides an expression language facility to help
developers perform common tasks such as integrating application components
and binding user interfaces to data sources. The language permits 'data sinks'
to be bound to 'data sources' by using dotted name expressions to reference
them via an 'environment'.<br>
<br>
At its core, spiralcraft.lang provides facilities for API users to parse expressions,
bind them to a Focus, and evaluate them as required. Likewise, it provides
facilities for SPI implementers to define namespaces which expose useful
information and interfaces. 
<h3>Architecture<br>
</h3>
<h4>Expression</h4>
A sequence of names, literal values and operators which resolve to a target
object (an application component or data value) when evaluated within the
context of a Focus. Users and integrators of applications which expose the
spiralcraft.lang syntax can use the language alone to customize a wide variety
of behavioral and presentation elements.<br>
<br>
Programmatically, an Expression is the compiled form of the language syntax
encoded to facilitate efficient binding.<br>
<h4>Channel</h4>
A Channel provides bidirectional access to a target object reachable from
a Focus, in a manner specified by an Expression. Application components can
use channels to reference their interaction peers or to read and modify data
points.<br>
<br>
Channels are composed of Optics, which are chained together into a tree which
composes a path from one or more aspects of the Focus the target of the channel.
<h4>Optic</h4>
An Optic provides a view of an application object or data value that is related
in some way to one or more source Opics. Optics are implemented by the spiralcraft.lang
package and by applications which implement the spiralcraft.lang SPI, providing
a broad array of functionality for navigating application object models and
transforming data.
<h4>Focus</h4>
A Focus represents the subject and environment  of expression evaluation.<br>
<br>
A Focus is associated with an Environment, which gives Channels access to
application or service provider specific namespaces.<br>
<br>
A Focus is optionally associated with a source Channel which represents the
subject of evaluation. This value may change over the course of time as application
behavior dictates the flow of focus by responding to user navigation or by
traversing a data structure such as a list, table, tree, etc,. As the target
of the source Channel changes, the changes will be propogated to the Channels
bound to the Focus.

<h3>Examples<br>
</h3>
<h4>Spreadsheet</h4>
User wants to provide an expression for a data value in a cell.<br>
<ul>
  <li>worksheet.paymentTable.columns.amount.sum<br>
Sum the amount column of this worksheet's payment table</li>
  <li>.left(5)&nbsp;<br>
The fifth cell to the left</li>
  <li><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Model</h4>
User wants to navigate a custom application data model.<br>
<ul>
  <li>customer.name<br>
Reference the customer name</li>
  <li>order.date.format("mm/dd/yyyy")<br>
Format the order date</li>
  <li>order.customer.region.title<br>
Obtain the title of the order customer's region</li>
  <li>order.customer.name + " : " + order.orderNumber<br>
Concatenate the customer's name and order number<br>
  </li>
</ul>
