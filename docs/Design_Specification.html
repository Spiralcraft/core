<h2>Design Specification</h2>
The spiralcraft-core module provides infrastructure to support the
Spiralcraft software development methodology. As infrastructure, its
purpose is to simplify the design, implementation, deployment and
support of many other modules. <br>
<h3>Design Principles<br>
</h3>
The core design principle of the Spiralcraft software development
methodology is the efficient long term management of complexity. By
efficiently managing software complexity, a software producer, through
the rapid development and long term maintanence of many software
products, can provide advanced capabilities and sustainable
productivity benefits to large numbers of end users over an
indefinitely long period of time, without expending an unreasonable
amount of effort. <br>
<br>
The term "complexity", for the purpose of this document, refers to
qualities of the software or environment which consume human effort. A
good subjective measure of complexity can be expressed as "the number
of things one has to deal with in order to accomplish a goal".
Effectively managing complexity is about reducing the number of things
a human has to consider to the minimum required to accomplish the goal.
<br>
<br>
Complexity is generated naturally over the course of time as the
environment in which software is created and deployed changes. Each
change in the environment adds complexity to the system, and will
result in some human effort being expended to deal with it. If the
system complexity is well managed, the human effort required to adjust
the system to the change should be minimal, or at least proportional to
some fraction of the extent of the change. On the other hand, if system
complexity is poorly managed, a small change in the environment may
result in a disproportionate amount of ongoing effort, which may itself
create more complexity. <br>
<br>
The fact that systems are subjected to constant change coupled with the
tendency for complexity to compound on itself creates the risk that
small failures in managing complexity can eventually spiral out of
control and negate any benefits created by the software. This risk is
mitigated by developing software using a methodology designed to manage
complexity in conjunction with an infrastructure that supports this
methodology.<br>
