<h2>spiralcraft-core module</h2>
<h3>Packages<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.loader.html">spiralcraft.loader</a><br>
    </b>Loads and invokes applications in a version and dependency
aware manner. Uses information maintained by the spiralcraft.versioning
package and shipped with modules to select the appropriate set of .jar
libraries and other code paths which will comprise the application
runtime.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.util</b><br>
Utilities to assist common programming tasks. Contains tools to
manipulate Strings, Arrays, and command line arguments and perform
common data conversions. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.reference.html">spiralcraft.reference</a><br>
    </b>A set of interfaces which allows different object stores
(filesystems, databases, directories, web sites) to reference each
other's objects within a well defined local group of systems. Assists
the integration of file systems, archives, databases and other object
stores by supporting the import, export and storage of object
references using locally unique identifiers (LUIDs) generated from the
native keying mechanism of the store.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.sax</b><br>
XML utilities based on SAX (simple API for XML). Contains a parse tree
to help cache SAX event sequences.</li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.builder.html">spiralcraft.builder<br>
    </a></b>A system for composing applications by defining
'Assemblies' using an XML dialect.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Separates declarative information which specifies composition
and configuration from Java code which specifies component behavior.</li>
      <li>Assumes the responsibilities of component instantiation,
configuration, and interconnection to increase reusability and decrease
complexity of Java components.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Provides an inheritance mechanism to permit multi-level
customization of Assemblies.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Provides local-singleton and expression based mechanisms to
simplify the interconnection of components, the resolution of
configuration parameters, and the seamless integration of add-on
systems.</li>
      <li>Forms a stable namespace hierarchy which makes application
components reachable for purposes of design, configuration and
monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.versioning</b><br>
(Planned) Encapsulates the versioning and dependency system used by
Spiralcraft to  track and load the set of modules required by any given
deployment. Provides  facilities to allow different versions of modules
to share the same virtual  machine.</li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.lang.html">spiralcraft.lang</a><br>
    </b>Expression language toolkit. Provides ability to expose and
access  dynamic data models at runtime using an intuitive Java-like
path expression syntax. Provides an API to allow developers to use
expressions, and an SPI for developers to bring their own object models
with the reach of expressions.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.stream<br>
    </b>Abstraction of 'stream resources' provides an interface for
applications  to retrieve low level InputStreams or OutputStreams from
arbitrary sources  using URIs. Includes support for relative paths, 
containership, and capabilities inquiry. Most components which need to
open  streams and traverse resource container hierarchies can be
implemented against  these interfaces for transparent support of
present and future 'stream resources',  for example files, jar
archives, web servers, cvs repositories, and devices.  Also contains
utilities to help with various aspects of dealing with streams.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.task<br>
    </b>(Planned) Abstraction of 'tasks' which can run asynchronously
and report progress.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.command<br>
    </b>(Planned) Scripting interface with a shell style syntax,
expression based parameter passing mechanism, and input/output stream
piping. Allows modules to expose catalogs of functionality to end users
in a flexible and platform independent manner.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.telemetry<br>
    </b>(Planned) Interface which provides a standard means for
components to report  operational statistics while ensuring minimum
impact on the runtime system  profile. System is composed of a tree of
'Meters', each of which contains  'Logs' for capuring events and
'Registers' for capturing statistics.</li>
