<h3>Packages<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.loader.html">spiralcraft.loader</a><br>
    </b>Loads and invokes Spiralcraft applications using a custom classloader,
in conjunction with the version and dependency management functionality contained
within the spiralcraft.versioning package.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.util</b><br>
Utilities to assist common programming tasks. Contains tools to manipulate
strings, arrays, and command line arguments.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.reference.html">spiralcraft.reference</a><br>
    </b>A set of interfaces which allows different object stores (filesystems,
databases, directories, web sites) to reference each other's objects within
a well defined local group of systems. Assists the integration of file systems,
archives, databases and other object stores by supporting the import, export
and storage of object references using locally unique identifiers (LUIDs)
generated from the native keying mechanism of the store.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.sax</b><br>
XML utilities based on SAX (simple API for XML). Contains a parse tree to
help cache SAX event sequences.</li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.builder.html">spiralcraft.builder</a><br>
    </b>A system that defines and instantiates interconnected graphs of Java
objects by defining 'assemblies' using an XML dialect. Using a human and
machine readable declarative XML syntax to define the context (configurable
properties, containership, and composition) of an application component or
assembly simplifies the development and maintenance of complex applications
over using Java method code for this purpose. This makes Java classes more
reusable by allowing them to focus on their behavior instead of their 'configuration'.
This also helps reap the benefits of polymorphism by making it easy to substitute
different implementations of individual application components at integration
time.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.versioning</b><br>
  (Planned) Encapsulates the versioning and dependency system used by Spiralcraft
to  track and load the set of modules required by any given deployment. Provides
 facilities to allow different versions of modules to share the same virtual
 machine.</li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.lang.html">spiralcraft.lang</a><br>
      </b>Expression language toolkit. Provides ability to expose and access
 dynamic data models at runtime using path expressions that are compiled
into  strongly typed bindings in order to support high performance repeated
evaluation.  Supports applications such as dynamic content generation and
runtime integration  of components by allowing developers who write components
and subsystems to cleanly expose functionality to application developers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.stream<br>
      </b>Abstraction of 'stream resources' provides an interface for applications
 to retrieve low level InputStreams or OutputStreams from arbitrary sources
 using URIs. Includes support for relative paths,  containership, and capabilities
inquiry. Most components which need to open  streams and traverse resource
container hierarchies can be implemented against  these interfaces for transparent
support of present and future 'stream resources',  for example files, jar
archives, web servers, cvs repositories, and devices.  Also contains utilities
to help with various aspects of dealing with streams.<br>
    </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.task<br>
      </b>(Planned) Abstraction of 'tasks' which can run asynchronously and
report progress.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.command<br>
      </b>(Planned) Scripting interface with a shell style syntax, expression
based parameter passing mechanism, and input/output stream piping. Allows
modules to expose catalogs of functionality to end users in a flexible and
platform independent manner.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.telemetry<br>
      </b>(Planned) Interface which provides a standard means for components
to report  operational statistics while ensuring minimum impact on the runtime
system  profile. System is composed of a tree of 'Meters', each of which contains
 'Logs' for capuring events and 'Registers' for capturing statistics.</li>
