<h2>spiralcraft-core module</h2>
<h3>Packages<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.loader<br>
    </b>Loads and invokes Spiralcraft applications using a custom classloader,
in conjunction with the version and dependency management functionality contained
within the spiralcraft.versioning package.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.versioning</b><br>
  (Planned) Encapsulates the versioning and dependency system used by Spiralcraft
to  track and load the set of modules required by any given deployment. Provides
 facilities to allow different versions of modules to share the same virtual
 machine.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.lang<br>
      </b>(Planned) Expression language toolkit. Provides ability to expose
and access  dynamic data models at runtime using path expressions that are
compiled into  strongly typed bindings in order to support high performance
repeated evaluation.  Supports applications such as dynamic content generation
and runtime integration  of components by allowing developers who write components
and subsystems to cleanly expose functionality to application developers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.stream<br>
      </b>(Planned) Abstraction of 'stream resources' provides an interface
for applications  to retrieve low level InputStreams or OutputStreams from
arbitrary sources  using a URL based naming convention. Includes support
for relative paths,  containership, and capabilities inquiry. Most components
which need to open  streams and traverse resource container hierarchies can
be implemented against  these interfaces for transparent support of present
and future 'stream resources',  for example files, jar archives, web servers,
cvs repositories, and devices.  Also contains utilities to help with various
aspects of dealing with streams.<br>
    </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.task<br>
      </b>(Planned) Abstraction of 'tasks' which can run asynchronously and
report progress.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.command<br>
      </b>(Planned) Scripting interface with a shell style syntax, expression
based parameter passing mechanism, and input/output stream piping. Allows
modules to expose catalogs of functionality to end users in a flexible and
platform independent manner.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.builder<br>
      </b>(Planned) XML based application scaffolding provides a declarative
mechanism  for instantiating application components, setting their properties,
and connecting  them together into assemblies. Assemblies can contain, extend
and reference  other assemblies within a hierarchical namespace to completely
define an application. Aspects of application structure can be conditioned
on deployment specific environment properties to support hassle free deployments.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.telemetry<br>
      </b>(Planned) Interface which provides a standard means for components
to report  operational statistics while ensuring minimum impact on the runtime
system  profile. System is composed of a tree of 'Meters', each of which
contains  'Logs' for capuring events and 'Registers' for capturing statistics.</li>
</ul>
