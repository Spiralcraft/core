<h2>spiralcraft-core module</h2>
The spiralcraft-core module provides a set of subsystems which support
the integration of application components. Add-on modules use
mechanisms in the spiralcraft-core module to expose data and
functionality to application components, system management utilities,
development tools and user interfaces..<br>
<h3>Functional Groups</h3>
<h4>Runtime control<br>
</h4>
Packages associated with tracking and running code in a managed
execution environment.
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.loader.html">spiralcraft.loader</a><br>
    </b>Contains mechanisms which control the loading, unloading and
sharing of code modules via the use of a library of versioning
information supplied by the individual modules. This package used in
conjunction with the spiralcraft-main module permits muliple versions
of a module to simultaneously run in the same VM under different
application contexts. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.exec</span><br>
Manages the instantiation and activation of application contexts, which
are relatively independent, cohesive collections of&nbsp; functionality
and resources. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.command<br>
    </b>Command line interface provides access to all application and
foundation functionality via a scriptable, text based system.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Application foundation&nbsp;</h4>
Packages which implement framework methodologies that underpin
Spiralcraft applications..<br>
<ul>
  <li><b><a
 href="file:///c:/work/dev/spiralcraft/modules/core/docs/spiralcraft.builder.html">spiralcraft.builder<br>
    </a></b>A system for composing applications by defining
'Assemblies' using an XML dialect:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Separates declarative information which specifies composition
and configuration from Java code which specifies component behavior.</li>
      <li>Assumes the responsibilities of component instantiation,
configuration, and interconnection to increase reusability and decrease
complexity of Java components.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Provides an inheritance mechanism to permit multi-level
customization of Assemblies.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Provides local-singleton and expression-language based
mechanisms to
simplify the interconnection of components, the resolution of
configuration parameters, and the seamless integration of add-on
systems.</li>
      <li>Forms a stable namespace hierarchy which makes application
components reachable for purposes of design, configuration and
monitoring.</li>
      <li>Implements persistence that is tolerant to code updates by
using information specified in Assemblies.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><a
 href="file:///c:/work/dev/spiralcraft/modules/core/docs/spiralcraft.lang.html">spiralcraft.lang</a><br>
    </b>The implementation of the expression language system used
throughout the Spiralcraft architecture.. Provides the ability to
expose and
access dynamic data models at runtime using an intuitive Java-like path
expression syntax. Provides an API to allow developers to use
expressions against existing object models, and an SPI for developers
to extend the reach of the expression language into alternative object
models.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.service</span></li>
Foundation of an application architecture where the application is
composed of various pluggable, interdependent Services with well
defined life cycles which expose a wide variety of interfaces for use
by user-driven compoenents.<br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.ui<br>
    </span>A User Interface abstraction which provides a common set of
interfaces and abstract classes for implementing the Controller role
within the Hierarchical Model/View/Controller design pattern. The UI
package is extended by toolkit specific View implementations and
business logic specific Model implementations, enabling a many-to-many
relationship between them in order to maximize code re-use.</li>
  <li><b><a
 href="file:///c:/work/dev/spiralcraft/modules/core/docs/spiralcraft.reference.html">spiralcraft.reference</a><br>
    </b>A set of interfaces which allows different object stores
(filesystems, databases, directories, web sites) to reference each
other's objects within a well defined group of services. Assists
the integration of file systems, archives, databases and other object
stores by supporting the import, export and storage of object
references
using locally unique identifiers (LUIDs) generated from the native
keying mechanism of the store.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.telemetry<br>
    </b>(Planned) Interface which provides a standard means for
components to report operational statistics while ensuring minimum
impact on the runtime system profile. System is composed of a tree of
'Meters', each of which contains 'Logs' for capuring events and
'Registers' for capturing statistics.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.task<br>
    </b>A mechanism for invoking granular units of functionality and
reporting detailed progress to a user interface or agent.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.tuple<br>
    </span>A system for representing and manipulating relational data.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Input/Output</span><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.xml</b><br>
General purpose XML parsing and processing utilities for applications
which manipulate XML fragments or provide interfaces based on subsets
or variants of XML.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.sax</b><br>
XML utilities based on SAX (simple API for XML) to facilitate the
reading and writing of XML data. Contains a parse tree
to help cache SAX event sequences.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.stream<br>
    </b>Provides an interface for
applications to manipulate byte level data from
arbitrary sources using URIs. Includes support for relative paths,
containership, and capabilities inquiry. Most components which need to
open streams and traverse resource container hierarchies can be
implemented against these interfaces for transparent support of present
and future 'stream resources', for example files, jar archives, web
servers, cvs repositories, and devices. Also contains utilities to
help with various aspects of programming streams.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><b>spiralcraft.stream.batch<br>
      </b>Batch oriented utilities to perform container hierarchy
traversal based operations such as searches and batch transformations
(eg. global search and replace).<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.prefs</span><br>
Tools based on the java.util.prefs API to support the loading and
storing of user and installation specific configuration data.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.text<br>
    </span></li>
Tools and interfaces to manipulate and filter character based data.<br>
</ul>
<h4>Management</h4>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.registry</span><br>
Facilitates management by providing a unified means of bidirectional
access from application object models to management tools for purposes
of configuration, monitoring and control.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.log<br>
    </span>Utilities which integrates the java logging package with the
spiralcraft.registry package to facilitate the inclusion and fine
grained control of logging functionality into most application
components.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Utility</h4>
Packages which facilitate common programming tasks
<ul>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.util</b><br>
Utilities to assist common programming tasks. Contains tools to
manipulate Strings, Arrays, and command line arguments and perform
common data conversions.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.beans</span><br>
Tools to manipulate and augment the java.beans API. Provides support
for caching BeanInfo results.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.pool<br>
    </span>An abstracted implementation of a pool, defined as a
collection of resources which grows and shrinks as needed to provide
low latency access to scarce resources.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.time</b><br>
Tools, such as a Clock and a Schedule, for implementing time-based
functionality.<br>
    <br>
