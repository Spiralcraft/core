<h2>spiralcraft-core module</h2>
The spiralcraft-core module is a set of subsystems which provide a
foundation for applications and other Spiralcraft modules. The
facilities in the spiralcraft-core module help to reduce application
complexity by separating out non-primary concerns related to
development, customization, deployment and communication.<br>
<h3>Functional Groups</h3>
<h4>Code resolution and execution<br>
</h4>
Packages associated with tracking and running code in a managed
execution environment.
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.loader.html">spiralcraft.loader</a><br>
    </b>A dynamic class loading and classpath management mechanism
which helps to manage codebases which consist of multiple versions of
independently developed modules. Provides a facility for managing a
codebase and defining sets of modules. Permits the simultaneous loading
of different versions of modules into the same VM in order to partition
deployments and mitigate inter-module dependency issues. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.exec</span><br>
A mechanism to invoke coarse grained application functionality from a
command line interface, or from the OS shell. Provides a facility for
defining units of functionality called Executables as well as their
classpath environment. Provides an execution path into a fully
configured, instantiated Object, via an interface which offers a
portable alternative to writing a main() method.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Application foundation&nbsp;</h4>
Packages which implement framework methodologies that underpin
Spiralcraft applications..<br>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.builder.html">spiralcraft.builder<br>
    </a></b>An inversion-of-control framework in which applications and
their components are composed of Assemblies defined in XML.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows for the declaration of the runtime structure of an
application, which simplifies the development of Java language
application components and increases their re-use value by permitting
the removal of dependencies.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Uses a reflection driven, setter-based dependency injection
mechanism driven by an XML dialect almost completely defined by the
Java codebase namespace.</li>
      <li>Uses spiralcraft.lang expressions to define property values.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Provides an inheritance mechanism which extends the Java
class namespace, permitting multiple levels of <br>
composition and customization.</li>
      <li>Provides a local-singleton mechanism to resolve shared
interfaces that have a defined scope, helping to avoid global static
instances without defining a new namespace. <br>
      </li>
      <li>(experimental) Provides a spiralcraft.tuple based persistence
mechanism, permitting application structure to be defined within data
mechanisms.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="spiralcraft.lang.html">spiralcraft.lang</a><br>
    </b>An expression language facility based on the Java language
syntax, with extensions to support application defined context.
  <ul>
    <li>Independent parsing, binding and evaluation stages help
maximize evaluation throughput.</li>
    <li>Context implementation permits application defined computation
envrionment.</li>
    <li>Focus implementation provides a closure mechanism for more
effecient development and execution.<br>
    </li>
    <li>SPI interfaces permit the bridging of namespaces (eg.
data-defined and Java Beans).</li>
    <li>Bi-directional pipeline based implementation supports both push
and pull data flow.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.service<br>
    </span>A mechanism for providing services (ie. singletons) to
application components. Includes a Daemon Executable for running
applications composed solely of Services.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.ui<br>
    </span>A User Interface abstraction which provides a common set of
interfaces and abstract classes for implementing the Controller role
within the Hierarchical Model/View/Controller design pattern. Helps
remove UI dependencies from application code. The UI
package is extended by toolkit specific View implementations and
application specific Model implementations.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.telemetry<br>
    </b>(Planned) Interface which provides a standard means for
components to report operational statistics while ensuring minimum
impact on the runtime system profile. A tree of
'Monitors' mirroring application structure expose 'Logs' for capuring
events and
'Registers' for capturing statistics.</li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.task<br>
    </b>A mechanism for invoking granular units of functionality
asynchronously and
reporting detailed progress to a user interface or agent. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.tuple<br>
    </span>A system for representing and manipulating relational data
using a transactional mechanism. An API and a minimal, in-memory
representation is provided as a basis for the integration of
independently developed implementations. Suitable as a data layer for
an object-relational mapping system or a data processing tool.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Input/Output</span><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.xml</b><br>
General purpose XML parsing and processing utilities for applications
which manipulate XML fragments or provide interfaces based on subsets
or variants of XML. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.sax</b><br>
XML utilities based on SAX (simple API for XML) to facilitate the
reading and writing of XML data. Contains a lightweight SAX event tree
help interpret and cache SAX event sequences generated from a resource.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.stream<br>
    </b>Provides an interface for
applications to manipulate byte level data from
arbitrary sources using URIs. Includes support for relative paths,
containership, and capabilities inquiry. Most components which need to
open streams and traverse resource container hierarchies can be
implemented against these interfaces for transparent support of present
and future 'stream resources', for example files, jar archives, web
servers, cvs repositories, and devices. Also contains utilities to
help with various aspects of programming streams.
  <ul>
    <li><b>spiralcraft.stream.batch<br>
      </b>Batch oriented utilities to perform container hierarchy
traversal based operations such as searches and batch transformations
(eg. global search and replace).<br>
    </li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.text<br>
    </span>
Tools and interfaces to manipulate and filter character based data.<br></li>
</ul>
<h4>Management</h4>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.registry</span><br>
Facilitates management by providing a unified means for management
tools and application object models to interact. Allows the data model
of the management tool to reflect the application object model,
avoiding error prone external configuration.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.log<br>
    </span>Utilities which integrate the java logging package with the
spiralcraft.registry package to facilitate the inclusion and fine
grained control of logging functionality into most application
components.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Utility</h4>
Packages which facilitate common programming tasks
<ul>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.util</b><br>
Utilities to assist common programming tasks. Contains tools to
manipulate Strings, Arrays, and command line arguments and perform
common data conversions.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.beans</span><br>
Tools to manipulate and augment the java.beans API. Provides support
for caching BeanInfo objects and application generated objects
associated with them.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">spiralcraft.pool<br>
    </span>An abstracted implementation of a pool, defined as a
collection of resources which grows and shrinks as needed to provide
low latency access to scarce resources. Suitable for thread pools and
database pools.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>spiralcraft.time</b><br>
Tools, such as a Clock and a Scheduler, for implementing time-based
functionality.<br>
