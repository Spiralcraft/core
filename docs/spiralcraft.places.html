<h2>spiralcraft.places package</h2>
The spiralcraft.places package is a framework for user navigation and
interaction within complex information systems. The concept of "place"
is a natural and pervasive means of organizing the world of information
regardless of whether or not it is formally applied to the design of
specific information systems. This package formalizes some aspects of
"place" to create interoperability between vehicles of user navigation
("UserAgents") and foci of user interaction within applications
("Places") to enable a global web of experience.<br>
<br>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<h4>Place</h4>
A Place is a focal point of user interaction. Places can be visited via
Gates, which control access to them. Places offer one or more types of
Views so they can be accessed by different kinds of UserAgents. Places
contain arbitrary items, which are accessed via the View. Places may
contain and link to other Places. Places may be uniquely identified to
support such external referencing.<br>
<br>
Some existing concepts which map well to the concept of Place are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Web Site</li>
  <li>Directory Tree</li>
  <li>Chat Room</li>
  <li>Forum or Bulletin Board</li>
  <li>Digital "listening room"</li>
  <li>On-line game arena</li>
  <li>Collaboration workspace<br>
  </li>
</ul>
A single Place may have multiple aspects- ie. Chat Room can be a place
within a Web Site and can be associated with a Directory Tree on the
host filesystem. <br>
<h4>UserAgent</h4>
A UserAgent is a representation of an end user's vehicle of system
interaction. From the perspective of the spiralcraft.places package,
the UserAgent provides information about the identity of the user and
the capabilities of various aspects of the interface they are using to
navigate and interact with a particular Place. A Gate will use the
interface capability information to provide the best View possible to a
given UserAgent, and will use security related information from the
UserAgent to control access to the Place.<br>
<br>
Some examples of UserAgents are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Graphical Web Browsers</li>
  <li>Command Line Interfaces</li>
  <li>Graphical User Interfaces<br>
  </li>
  <li>Cell Phone Browsers</li>
  <li>Voice Telephones</li>
  <li>Automated Processes (Task Robots)</li>
</ul>
<h4>View</h4>
A View is a means for a UserAgent to interact with a Place. Different
typs of UserAgents will be able to use different types of Views. All
Places provide a primitive View which permits access by command line
syle interfaces which all UserAgents can implement. Most Places will
provide more sophisticated Views geared towards the functional
capabilities of common UserAgents.<br>
<br>
<h4>Gate</h4>
A Gate provides access to a Place by providing an appropriate View to
the UserAgent based on security information and user interface
capabilities. A Place always has at least one Gate. <br>
<br>
Sometimes Places have additional Gates which provide Views of different
aspects- ie. a Web Site may offer a primary View of its content as well
as an administrative view of the filesystem where the content resides
and even perhaps an administrative view of traffic patterns for the
site. Different Gates are likely to have different security criteria as
well. <br>
<br>
<h3>Place Resolution Protocol</h3>
A simple protocol which defines how a UserAgent establishes an
interface with a Place is required to ensure interoperability.<br>
<br>
<h4>Gate Resolution</h4>
A reference to the Gate is obtained somehow<br>
<br>
<h4>Gate Open Request</h4>
The User Agent requests that the gate open for it.<br>
<br>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
The Gate obtains authentication information from the User Agent via one
of the methods supported by both the User Agent and the Gate<br>
<br>
<h4>View Negotiation</h4>
The Gate enumerates the View interfaces supported by the User Agent and
instantiates a View instance according to the highest scored preference
of the UserAgent and the View.<br>
<br>
<h4>View Incorporation.</h4>
The UserAgent incorporates the new View into the relevent part of the
user interface.<br>
