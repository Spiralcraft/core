<h3>Type System</h3>
The spiralcraft.data.Type interface is the heart of metadata definition
in the spiralcraft.data framework. Every data element is described by a
Type. In addition, a Type contains some intelligence to validate
instance data and to translate between different runtime
representations.<br>
<h4>Data Structure<br>
</h4>
A Type comes in one of three basic flavors; primitive, complex and
aggregate. These three categories are sufficient to model most any data
structure.<br>
<ul>
  <li>A primitive Type describes a data element that is indivisible
within the spiralcraft.data system, such as a string, a number, a
boolean value, etc. An instance of a primitive Type is represented at
runtime as a native immutable Java object (ie. an instance of a String,
Integer, Boolean, etc.).</li>
  <li>A complex Type describes a data element that is composed of a
specific sequence of distinctly named, closely related sub-elements,
each of which is described by a Field. A Field describes the name and
Type of the sub-element, as well as some additional constraints. The
full set of Fields which describe a complex type is a Scheme. An
instance of a complex type is represented at runtime as a
spiralcraft.data.Tuple instance. A Tuple is somewhat equivalent to a
row in a database, and can be used to represent the data values of some
problem domain object.</li>
  <li>An aggregate Type describes a data element that is an arbitrarily
sized collection of sub-elements of a common base Type. An instance of
an aggregate Type is represented at runtime as a
spiralcraft.data.Aggregate instance. An Aggregate is similar to an
array or a database relation, and can be used to represent a collection
or container of some problem domain object.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Type Identity and Resolution<br>
</h4>
Types are identified by absolute URIs. Any Type that can be referenced
through the spiralcraft.data framework is uniquely identifiable by a
specific absolute URI.<br>
<br>
The spiralcraft.data.TypeResolver component is responsible for
resolving these URIs into actual Types. The TypeResolver manages all of
the Types used by the spiralcraft.data framework. <br>
<h5>Runtime Identity<br>
</h5>
A Type is represented at runtime as an immutable object- an instance of
the spiralcraft.data.Type interface- returned by the
TypeResolver.resolve(URI typeUri) method. The type resolver will always
resolve the same (identical) Type object for an <span
 style="font-style: italic;">equivalent</span> URI. Formally: <code><br>
<br>
</code>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><code>uri1.equals(uri2) -&gt;
TypeResolver.resolve(uri1)==TypeResolver.resolve(uri2)</code> <br>
<br>
</div>
This means that the == operator is useful when comparing two Types for
identity. The Type.equals() method is useful to determine Type
equivalence, and will determine whether all attributes of two Types are
equivalent, regardless of whether or not they have equivalent URIs.<br>
<h5>Type Resolution</h5>
A URI for a given Type indirectly contains the information required to
instantiate the Type object. Once instantiated, the Type object will be
"loaded" into the TypeResolver and permanently associated with its URI
for future retrieval.<br>
<br>
The operation of the TypeResolver parallels that of the Java
ClassLoader. A TypeResolver instance is associated with each nested
ClassLoader instance and is responsible for managing the Types defined
by resources visible through its associated ClassLoader. The
TypeResolver will always delegate to its parent TypeResolver
(associated with the parent ClassLoader) first, and then try to resolve
the URI itself if its parent was unsuccessful. This provides some
stability by maintaining a 'steady-state' where standard Types resolved
from parent TypeResolvers/ClassLoaders cannot
be arbitrarily redefined.<br>
<h4>Type Inheritance Mechanisms</h4>
The spiralcraft.data framework supports three different Type
inheritance mechanisms, each tailored to a specific design concern.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Domain inheritance provides a means for parameterization or
configuration of a base Type. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Archetype inheritance provides a means for re-using generic
implementation of data structure and functionality.</li>
  <li>Extent inheritance provides a means to define polymorphism in
data along with a degree of virtualization through the extension of
identity.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Domain Inheritance<br>
</h5>
Domain inheritance is a facility which allows a new Type to
parameterize the behavior of base Type in a manner pre-defined by the
base Type. It is typically used to create a derivative Type which
restricts the set of allowable values for a base Type by specifying a
range of allowable values, an enumerated set of allowable values, a
format, or some other data element that has been parameterized by the
base Type.<br>
<br>
This mechanism is implemented by virtue of the fact that Types
themselves are described by data. Every Type has a meta-Type, which is
another Type that describes the data structure of the Type definition
itself and provides a means for creating new instances of the Type with
customized attributes. A single meta-Type can be used to define an
unlimited number of more specific Types. <br>
<br>
For example, the metatype of the standard String type is a StringType.
The StringType has a "maxLength" attribute, which allows us to create a
new Type based on the String type, let's call it ShortString, for
example to restrict the length of the values contained to, say, 256
characters. <br>
<h5>Archetype Inheritance<br>
</h5>
Archetype inheritance allows a sub-Type to inherit the data structure
of another Type (the Archetype), as a means of reusing structure and
generic functionality defined in terms of the Archetype. Archetypes are
used when a common data structure, for example, an Address, has some
associated generic functionality to display, edit, verify, or otherwise
manipulate an Address, and there is a need to contextualize the Address
into a specific data model by creating a sub-Type of, for example,
CustomerShippingAddress which has an Address as its archetype. The
CustomerShippingAddress behaves as an Address would, and is
recognizable by the generic Address components, but adds fields such as
the Customer id and other contextual information.<br>
<h5>Extent Inheritance<br>
</h5>
Extent inheritance allows a sub-Type to inherit the identity, data
structure, and functionality of a super-Type. When instantiated, a
separate runtime representation called an "extent" is created for each
Type in the inheritance hierarchy to form a compound instance. The
extents for a given sub-Type are tightly coupled, especially for the
purpose of modification, but are independently addressable. <br>
<br>
Extents are used when a general Type, for example, a Part, is referred
to in the context of a broader data model, where each instance of a
Part is also an instance of a more specific Type such as an BlockPart
or a DiscPart, each of which have a specific set of Fields not relevant
to the other specific Types. The BlockPart might have a height,width,
and length, and a DiscPart might have a diameter, for instance. An
Order, for instance, can refer to a collection of Parts in a general
manner, but the Order printing functionality can select a format that
is cognizant of the specific Type in order to output data specific to
that type.<br>
<br>
Each extent within a compound instance maintains its own localized data
as well as references to the most specific extent and to its more
general parent extent. For instance, Part #150 is a BlockPart, and the
compound instance has a Part extent and a BlockPart extent. The Part
extent contains the part number (150), the unit price, and a reference
to the BlockPart extent as its specific extent. The BlockPart extent
contains the height, width, and length, and a reference to the Part
extent as its parent extent.<br>
<h5>Combining Archetype and Extent Inheritance</h5>
The Archetype and Extent Inheritance methods are orthogonal and can be
combined. In the above example, the BlockPart can extend Part, and have
an archetype of Block. The Block archetype contributes the height,
width, and length Fields, which the Part extent contributes the part
number and unit price fields. <br>
<br>
If it happens that the same field name is defined in both an Archetype
(or for that matter, any specific extent), as well as a general extent,
no specific conflict occurs, though the specific extent and the general
extent will each contain separate data for their own Field definition.
When accessing the Field by unqualified name from the perspective of
the specific extent, the specific data will be used, 'hiding' the
general data. The general data is not hidden when accessing the Field
from the perspective of the general extent. This situation may result
in unexpected behavior in ad-hoc operations that reference the specific
context and do not explicitly disambiguate the field reference.<br>
<h4>Type Factories</h4>
The TypeResolver relies on Type Factories
(spiralcraft.data.TypeFactory) to create Types from URIs. When a
TypeResolver first resolves a specific URI, the URI will be passed to a
chain of Type Factories in sequence until one of them "recognizes" the
URI and creates a Type. This type will become the "canonical" Type for
the specified URI. <br>
<br>
A specific Type Factory defines how it "recognizes" a URI, but the
process typically involves translating the URI into some kind of
resource or external data reference which provides enough information
to create an instance of the Type interface. Custom Type Factories can
be added to the TypeResolver to map foreign type systems into the
spiralcraft.data framework.<br>
<br>
The TypeResolver, by default, contains four built-in Type Factories
which work together to "bootstrap" the spiralcraft.data type resolution
mechanism. They are, in order of resolution sequence:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the XmlTypeFactory (spiralcraft.data.sax.XmlTypeFactory)</li>
  <li>the CoreTypeFactory (spiralcraft.data.core.CoreTypeFactory)</li>
  <li>the BuilderTypeFactory
(spiralcraft.data.builder.BuilderTypeFactory)</li>
  <li>the ReflectionTypeFactory
(spiralcraft.data.wrapper.ReflectionTypeFactory)</li>
</ul>
The Type resolution mechanism implemented by the built-in Type
Factories is designed to self-define its own extension mechanisms.
Therefore, the following descriptions may involve some recursive logic.<br>
<h5>XmlTypeFactory</h5>
The XmlTypeFactory creates types by loading their definitions from an
XML data file in a standard format. It locates a resource named
&lt;TypeURI&gt;.type.xml which is expected to be in the standard
spiralcraft.data internal XML data format, and to contain Tuple data
where the root object is a meta-Type (a Type with a nativeClass that
implements the Type interface). The XmlTypeFactory loads this data, and
uses the meta-Type fromData() method to instantiate the Type.<br>
<br>
This is the primary mechanism for creating new Types through domain
inheritance and for specifying the data structure of custom Types.<br>
<br>
The specific resource can be anything reachable through the
spiralcraft.stream package, including classpath, file and network based
URIs.<br>
<h5>CoreTypeFactory</h5>
The CoreTypeFactory creates types by instantiating a Java class that
directly implements the spiralcraft.data.Type interface. It locates the
Java class in the classpath using a specific transformation of the Type
URI. This only considers URIs that reference the classpath. If the
class is not found, the CoreTypeFactory will defer to the next
TypeFactory in the chain. If the class does not implement the
spiralcraf.data.Type interface, an exception will be thrown.<br>
<br>
The transformation is as follows: The path in the TypeURI is stripped
of the leading '/', and all remaining '/' characters are replaced with
'.'. The suffix "Type" is appended to the result. So a Type URI of
"class:/mytree/mypackage/MyWidget" turns into a class name of
"mytree.mypackage.MyWidgetType". <br>
<br>
This is the mechanism used for the standard types and the meta types.
It serves to "ground" the Type resolution mechanism to a concrete Java
class that implements the Type interface. These types are often
extended using the XML data format / XmlTypeFactory mechanism to refer
to a ReflectionType of this class as the "meta-Type".<br>
<h5>BuilderTypeFactory</h5>
The BuilderTypeFactory creates types that mirror the structure of
spiralcraft.builder.AssemblyClass definitions. It locates a
spiralcraft.builder AssemblyClass resource named
&lt;TypeURI&gt;.assembly.xml. The BuilderType instance that is created
has fields which reflect the structure defined in the specified
AssemblyClass. It provides bi-directional transformations between data
trees and spiralcraft.builder.Assembly trees, and is useful for
persisting and depersisting application state in a managed fashion<br>
<h5>ReflectionTypeFactory</h5>
The ReflectionTypeFactory creates Types that mirror Java classes. It
locates a Java class in the classpath using a specific transformation
of the Type URI. This only considers URIs that reference the classpath.
If the class is
not found, the ReflectionTypeFactory will defer to the next TypeFactory
in the chain.<br>
<br>
The class is treated as a Java bean, and the bean properties provide
the basis for the Field definitions. The Type provides bi-directional
transformations between trees of Java beans and trees of data. It is
intended to represent an Object graph in data form.<br>
<br>
When the class target of a ReflectionType implements the Type interface
itself (ie. a Core type), the result is a meta-Type, or a Type which
describes a Type. Coupled with the built-in XML data format and the
XmlTypeFactory, the Type definition and domain inheritance mechanism is
realized.<br>
<br>
The Type URI to class name transformation is as follows: The path in
the TypeURI is stripped
of the leading '/', and all remaining '/' characters are replaced with
'.'. So a Type URI of
"class:/mytree/mypackage/MyWidget" turns into a class name of
"mytree.mypackage.MyWidget". <br>
