	<p>A lightweight 2PC Transaction model that provides basic data update
	  atomicity, consistency, and isolation services to synchronize multiple
	  Resources, such as external database servers as well as core buffer and
	  caching structures.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Usage:</h4>

	<p>
		A component wants to trigger a transactional update of a resource, which
		may be Transaction aware at some point in the call chain. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Transactions are scoped to Threads, and so the call chain must fall 
		within the bounds of the try block.
  </p>
	
	<p>
	The component initiates a Transaction:
	<pre>
		try
		{ 
			Transaction transaction 
				= Transaction.startContextTransaction(Transaction.Nesting.PROPOGATE);
			
			// do some work
			
			transaction.commit();
		}
		finally
		{
		  transaction.complete();
		}
	</pre>			
	</p>

	<p>
	A transaction-aware component in the call-chain gets a request to do some
	  work. 
	<pre>
		public void doMyWork()
		{
			Transaction transaction 
				= Transaction.getContextTransaction(); 
				
			if (transaction!=null)
			{ 
			}	
		
			try
			{ 
			
				// do some work
			
			transaction.commit();
		}
		finally
		{
		  transaction.complete();
		}
	</pre>			
	</p>

	<p>The purpose of the spiralcraft.lang package is to provide
	  an EL based integration layer that can tie together application components
	  that have not been built to be aware of each other. The integration layer 
	  is geared towards maximizing expressive power and minimizing coupling, from
	  a developer's perspective, while maximining concurreny and minimizing 
	  per-thread resource utilization. 
	</p>
	
	<p>The EL is implemented through the creation of Channels from compiled
	  Expressions. These Channels are bound to data sources exposed by the
	  application via a hierarchy of Focus objects. 
	</p>

	<p>A Channel is a bidirectional "pipe" through which data moves. A Channel
	  is linked to other Channels as an analog of the Expression structure, and
	  as defined by "pseutotypes" called Reflectors. 
	</p>
	
	<p>A Reflector resolves "parameterized names", and is a fascade for whatever
	  typing system (or lack thereof) is being exposed. A Reflector for 
	  java.lang.Class is included, which provides a java.beans "default"
	  mapping and provides access to Object methods and properties. 
	</p>
	
	<p>A common use of this package is to provide a reusable set of 
	  View-Controller components, such as WebUIs, GUIs, templates, monitors, etc.,
	  with a means 
	  to interoperate with different Model architectures, often in the same 
	  system, using Expressions and "psuedotypes" (spiralcraft.lang.Reflector) 
	  to map query and input Channels (spiralcraft.lang.Channel) into a given
	  application model. 
	</p>
	
	<p>The spiralcraft.lang package has two modes of extension.
	</p>

  <ul> 
    <li>An <i>expression container</i> uses the API to enable a user or
      developer to author or customize the manner in which the UI interacts
      with an application model, via the Expression, Focus and Channel
      interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>A new Reflector implementation maps spiralcraft.lang contracts and
      APIs to an application mdodel architecture.
    </li>
  </ul>
	
	
	<p>Specifically, the spiralcraft.lang package supports the following 
  	characteristics:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>An Expression Language defines inter-layer relationships
  	  <p>Expressions are used by user interfaces or other controllers to
  	  dereference, update and perform computations on components of an
  	  application object model via bidirectional Channels. 
  	  </p>	
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>The Expression Language hides concurrency issues from the end user
  	  or "scripter".
  	  <p>Expressions are linked to metadata in the binding stage, and are not
  	    inherently stateful (ie. they do not "hold" data). The actual data is
  	    typically passed through the thread stack. Therefore the
  	    Expression container may implement concurrency strategies where 
  	    multiple operations defined by the same set of metadata occur 
  	    simultaneously on different threads. This is not visible to the end
  	    user or scripter, who simply writes expressions without concern for
  	    the underlying "data referencing" method. 
  	  </p> 
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>Expressions are pre-parsed
  	  <p>Expressions are parsed into a parse-tree of Nodes
  	    (spiralcraft.lang.parser.Node) only once when they are loaded. The
  	    parse tree may also be created or manipulated directly to efficiently
  	    generate Expressions from language oriented components or a user
  	    interface.
  	  </p>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>Expressions are bound at runtime and "typed" dynamically.
  		<p>The Expression parse-tree of Nodes is resolved against an application 
  		  object model at runtime to produce a Channel which is bound to the data 
  		  source. The Channel is associated with a strong (fixed) datatype, but 
  		  it may be repeatedly queried, listened to or updated to the extent 
  		  supported by the actual composition of the target application model.
  		</p>
  		
  		<p>The runtime binding process enables the use of Expressions
  		  as configuration elements, as user-supplied customization elements,
  		  or in other external resources. 
  	  </p>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>Expression evaluation minimizes CPU overhead when compared to 
  	  interpretation
  	  
  	  <p>All of the name resolution and reflection based logic is handled at 
  	    the bind stage and is "compiled" into a Binding tree
  	    (spiralcraft.lang.spi.Binding) which comprises the data access and
  	    computation operations that feed a Channel. Each leaf of the Binding
  	    tree references a "variable", or a window on a specific data value
  	    that may change.    	    
  	  </p> 
  	  
  	  <p>Once "compiled", an expression can be repeatedly evaluated as the 
  	    underlying data changes, or it may listen for changes if this mode
  	    is supported. This behavior is geared towards the efficient processing
  	    or filtering of large datasets.
  	  </p>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>Expression evaluation minimizes the memory overhead of concurrency.
  	
  		<p>Channels comprise a set of operations, and are not inherently stateful,
  		  so they may be shared by multiple threads simultaneously. They may do
  		  this even while examining different data through the use of 
  		  "thread local storage" via the ThreadLocalBinding 
  		  (spiralcraft.lang.spi.ThreadLocalBinding), which eliminates the
  		  creation of a redundant Binding tree for each thread.
  		</p>
		</li>
		

  	
  	<li>Expressions can address multiple application layers
  	 
  	  <p>The namespace accessible to an Expression is configurable by the 
  	   expression container to expose various entry points into the
  	   application model(s) under consideration. A chain of Focus objects
  	   addressable by URI provides access to various external entities and
  	   often to the expression container itself, providing loose coupling
  	   between multiple application layers. As the expressions are expressed
  	   within the context they are used and pull in relevant non-local context,
  	   an inversion of control effect is achieved. This feature is of use from
  	   application configuration and user interface construction perspectives.
  	     
  	  </p>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>Expression can be confined to a narrow Focus
  		<p>Expressions can be used efficiently in situations where a limited
  		  namespace is exposed if the expression container chooses to use local 
  		  names instead of URIs when setting up the Focus chain. This feature
  		  is of use from a data processing perspective.
  		</p>
  	</li>
  	
  	<li>Expressions can address multiple application model architectures
  	 
  	  <p>The Reflector interface is implemented to map names and operations
  	    into a specific model architecture. Channels supported by different
  	    Reflector implementations can coexist in the same application 
  	    and reference different model architectures, such as database data
  	    represented as Tuples, for instance, and Java object models.
  	  </p>
  	</li>

  	<li>The typing system is grounded in Beans and Class reflection.
  	  
  	  <p>A Channel with a custom type system (database data, for example) 
  	    can support a property accessor defined by a different type
  	    system. A Java reflection based Reflector implementation gives any 
  	    custom type system the ability to return Java objects and boxed
  	    primitives. 
  	  </p> 
 
  	</li>
  	

  </ul>

	<h3>Implementation Overview</h3>
	
	<p>Expressions may be parsed from text into a parse tree made up of Nodes
	  (spiralcraft.lang.parser.Node). See Expression.parse(). 
	</p>
	
	<p>The Node Tree may be programatically created by direct manipulation of
	  Nodes to avoid text processing. Likewise, a Note Tree tree may be analyzed
	  to determine the logic being performed and optimize it or translate it
	  into another language (for example, SQL).	  
	</p>

	<p>A static cache is maintained to avoid parsing the same Expression more 
	  than once. Identical text will always result in an identical Node tree.
	</p>
	
	<p>An Expression is bound to a Focus to create a Channel.
	</p>
	
	<p>A Channel is a bidirectional data window or pipe which supports a simple 
	  get() and set() interface. Calling get() is equivalent to evaluating the
	  expression. Calling set() is applicable if the expression is "reversible"- 
	  for instance a data element that is retrieved may sometimes be altered. 
	</p>
	
	<p>The data handled by the Channel is defined by a Reflector, a pseudo-type
	  which describes the set of names and operations available to the EL 
	  specific to the data provided by the channel. Since different containers
	  may provide access to different typing systems (ie. Beans, SQL, etc), the
	  Reflector serves as a "fascade" so the the spiralcraft.lang package can
	  use the "services" provided by a type system in a standard fashion.
	</p>
	
	<p>A Focus is a "starting point" provided by a container for EL evaluation.
	  It exposes the set of data sources available to an Expression. 
	  It normally references some "default" Channel called a "subject", 
	  which is the primary target against which the expression will be evaluated. 
	  This subject Channel is usually provided by the container, which sets up
	  the environment and scenario for the use of the spiralcraft.lang package.
	</p>
	 
	<p>An Expression may specify, using a qualified Focus specifier enclosed in
	  square
	  brackets, an alternate Focus against which to evaluate the expression. The
	  name may map to a URI mapped from the type or supertype of the subject
	  of the focus, and/or to a URI set up by the container to identify the
	  integration point represented by the Focus. It may additionally identify
	  an application layer associated with this integration point.
	</p>
	
	<p>The focus Specifier is resolved by virtue of the primary Focus
	  delegating to a "parent" Focus or to other referenced Focus objects to
	  search for the alternate Focus name. The specific organization of Focus 
	  objects is intimately related to the structure of the actual application.
