	<p>A toolkit for building active context hierarchies to implement 
	  application structure and behavior in a UI-neutral manner.
	</p>
	
	<p>An active context hierarchy is composed of Components defined
	  relative to context (state, data, Components, resources, etc.) made
	  visible by their ancestors in the containership hierarchy, where 
	  Components communicate using a message and event model.
	</p>
	
        <p>Supports the portability of applications to different UIs or to
          non-interactive mode using a mix of declarative composition 
          and customizable automatic UI component mapping.
        </p>
	
        <p>Capable of a high degree of parallelism when using multiple state
          trees, such is in a multi-user or multi-view application.
        </p>
        
        <p>The separation of state and configuration results in lightweight
          session state where necessary, and allows for robust components 
          without incurring additional memory cost for additional parallelism,
          as would be the case where the component tree is instantiated for
          each session.
