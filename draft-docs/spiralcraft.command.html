<h2>spiralcraft.command package</h2>
The spiralcraft.command package implements an abstracted command line
interface for resolving and invoking functionality exposed by the
Spiralcraft platform and applications built on top of it.<br>
<br>
This package does not implement a shell application per-se as it does
not provide for command editing functionality. It does, however,
provide mechanisms to support a shell interface.<br>
<h3>Assumptions of the Command paradigm</h3>
The Command interface is an ideal low level access mechanism for a
software platform. When application functionality is exposed within the
context of a properly designed command interface, a natural boundary is
created between functionality and presentation which facilitates the
addition of alternative interfaces; for example graphical interfaces
and voice response systems. Most alternative interfaces can also
produce a command line analog as default behavior if a specific UI
component is not available for an application component. <br>
<br>
Current and legacy implementations of command line interfaces suffer
from some common problems which require resolution before the command
line interface can be made suitable for the control of a large scale,
open ended object oriented platform. Many aspects of the Spiralcraft
command interface are designed to solve these problems. <br>
<h4>Contextual namespace instead of flat namespace or sequential
resolution.<br>
</h4>
Brief command names are desirable as they increase the usability of an
interface. In a flat namespace where multiple uncoordinated developers
add functionality, brevity quickly comes into conflict with uniqueness.<br>
<br>
Providing a hierarchical set of command 'contexts' solves this problem.
When a command context chooses to inherit commands from its parent
'context', security concerns dictate that it cannot override its
parent's commands. This ensures that the user will always obtain a
predictable result when they type in a command.<br>
<h4>Object-centric instead of file-centric<br>
</h4>
OS command line interfaces are predominantly oriented around the file
system. 'Navigation' is accomplished by 'change directory' operations.<br>
In an open ended object oriented application platform, however, the
file system is but one of many different systems which can be the focus
of user interaction.<br>
<br>
This package solves this problem by providing a mechanism for
applications to expose 'command contexts', and for the end user to
navigate them.<br>
<h4>Well defined parameter collection instead of text or 'filespec'
typed&nbsp; variable argument lists.<br>
</h4>
Most command line interfaces pass textual arguments to their targets,
requiring the target component to support some facility for
interpreting those arguments. This is both a burden for the target
component and a deviation from the goal of having the command line
interface serve as a common denominator for accessing functionality, as
graphical user interfaces do not normally depend on exclusively passing
textual arguments to the components they control.<br>
<br>
This package provides a means for passing a well defined ParameterSet
to
commands.<br>
<h3>Typical Use Case<br>
</h3>
A user agent (UA) obtains a new instance of a CommandContext.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Since a user agent's primary means of
interaction is via a CommandContext, there must be some chain of
CommandContexts. Each CommandContext will have a set of subcontexts the
user agent can use to navigate a system.<br>
<br>
Access to CommandContexts is a secure operation- requiring specific
action to resolve an access path results in a positively defined
security model.<br>
<br>
<br>
</div>
UA finds an appropriate Command within the CommandContext.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Commands are cataloged for use by
introspective UI based mechanisms (help, menus, etc).<br>
<br>
</div>
UA retrieves a new ParameterSet from the command, and fills in
appropriate parameters.<br>
<br>
UA creates a new Invocation with the CommandContext, Command,
ParameterSet<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
The Invocation tracks the status and result of the Command execution.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
An Invocation may generate messages<br>
<br>
An Invocation may throw an exception<br>
<br>
Invocations and their output are journalled<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
<br>
<h4>What is the difference between a command and a method?</h4>
Commands are imperatives, invoked by a user or a user agent to direct
the system to perform some activity to further some goal.<br>
<br>
Methods can be analogous to commands, but are a much more general
mechanism. Many methods do nothing but return values. Other methods
encapsulate operations that do not normally terminate. <br>
<br>
<h4>Why are commands needed instead of just using methods via
reflection?</h4>
User agents need to inquire as to the set of commands available within
a given context.<br>
<br>
An object in a controller role may have as its primary purpose the
responsibility for defining and exposing the set of commands available<br>
<br>
A command provides a useful basis for managing high level invocations
of functionality- an Invocation can hold the state of command execution
and encapsulate the result or any exceptions generated.<br>
<br>
A command context assumes the presence of a user agent, whereas a
method call does not. The presence of a user agent permits the command
target to post messages, check security, and perform other actions that
take advantage of the user agent communication channel.<br>
<br>
<h4>What are the problems with different methods of parameter passing?</h4>
Variable string arguments: All strings must be parsed and interpreted.
Burden of interpretation is on non-reusable, application specific
implementation, which lacks contextual information available to user
agent.<br>
<br>
Variable object arguments: Positional interface is not reliable, unless
string identifiers used, which must be parsed. <br>
<br>
Dictionary arguments: Passing anything requires assignment of a
dictionary name, which increases naming complexity. Simple commands
with one argument would be made highly inefficient.<br>
<br>
<h4>How would Arguments object work?</h4>
Each command would provide a new Arguments object. The Arguments object
would provide a queryable list of Argument names and data types, which
represent the interface to the command. The argument names would be
available as constants for compilation and runtime efficiency, or could
be managed as text strings by UA's that are more ad-hoc in nature. If a
UA tried to apply an argument that was invalid or the wrong type, an
exception would be thrown before the Command was executed.<br>
<br>
A direct mapping between variable string arguments with "options" is
possible here. <br>
